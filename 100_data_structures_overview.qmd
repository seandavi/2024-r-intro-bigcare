title: "R Data Structures"
---


Welcome to the section on R data structures! As you begin your journey in
learning R, it is essential to understand the fundamental building blocks of
this powerful programming language. R offers a variety of data structures to
store and manipulate data, each with its unique properties and capabilities. In
this section, we will cover the core data structures in R, including:

* Vectors 
* Matrices 
* Lists 
* Data.frames

By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of these data
structures, and you will be able to choose and utilize the appropriate data
structure for your specific data manipulation and analysis tasks.

In each chapter, we will delve into the properties and usage of each data
structure, starting with their definitions and moving on to their practical
applications. We will provide examples, exercises, and active learning
approaches to help you better understand and apply these concepts in your work.

## Chapter overview

* Vectors : In this chapter, we will introduce you to the simplest data
  structure in R, the vector. We will cover how to create, access, and
  manipulate vectors, as well as discuss their unique properties and
  limitations.
* Matrices
  : Next, we will explore matrices, which are two-dimensional data structures
  that extend vectors. You will learn how to create, access, and manipulate
  matrices, and understand their usefulness in mathematical operations and data
  organization.
* Lists
  : The third chapter will focus on lists, a versatile data structure that can
  store elements of different types and sizes. We will discuss how to create,
  access, and modify lists, and demonstrate their flexibility in handling
  complex data structures.
* Data.frames
  : Finally, we will examine data.frames, a widely-used data structure for
  organizing and manipulating tabular data. You will learn how to create,
  access, and manipulate data.frames, and understand their advantages over
  other data structures for data analysis tasks.
* Arrays
  : While we will not focus directly on the `array` data type, which are
  multidimensional data structures that extend matrices, they are very similar
  to matrices, but with a third dimension. 


As you progress through these chapters, practice the
examples and exercises provided, engage in discussion, and collaborate
with your peers to deepen your understanding of R data structures. This solid
foundation will serve as the basis for more advanced data manipulation,
analysis, and visualization techniques in R.
