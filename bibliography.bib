  abstract = "A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for
              analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data
              cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a
              small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying.
              Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and
              have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each
              observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a
              table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because
              only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of
              un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop
              tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output
              tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and
              matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from
              mundane data manipulation chores.",
